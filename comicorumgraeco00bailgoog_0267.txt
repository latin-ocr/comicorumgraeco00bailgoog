Wreteh! find new gods to witness to new lies,
Thy perjuries have made the old too wise.

Dost know whom thou'rt to sup with, friend?-I'll tell thee ;
With gladiatore, not with peaceful guests3
Instead of knives we're arm'd with naked words,
And swallow firebrands in the place of food:
Daggers of Crete are serv'd us for confectione,
And for a plnte of pease a fricassee
Of shatter’d spemn: the cnshions we repose on
Are shields and bremt-platee, at our feet a pile
Of slings and arrows, and om· foreheads wreath'd '
With military ensigns, not with myrtle.

Know'st thou with 'whom thou hant to deal?
On sharpen'd swords we make ourmea13
The dripping torch, snapdragon-wise‚

Our burning beverage supplies3

And Oretic shasts, as sweetmeats stol-ed,
Form the dessert upon om· board,

With tid-bita of split javelin:

Pillow'd on bremt-plens we recline; ⁹
Strew’d at our feet ere slings and bows,
And crown'd with catapulta our brows.

Herken my word: wote thou, leve² brother min,
Thou shulde in certaine thys daie wyth us din.
Bright swerdes and eke browne our vittaile been ς
Torches we glot’ fot sowle³, that fyerie bren.
