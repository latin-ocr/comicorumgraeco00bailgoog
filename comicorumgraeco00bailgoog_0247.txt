uPIoHAnMUS. (ur.)

Good gossip, if you love me, prote no more:
What are your genealogies to me?

Away to those, who have more need of them!
Iret the degenerate wretohes‚ if they can,

Dig up deod honour from their fathers’ tombs,
And boast it for their own-Vain empty boant!
When every common fellow, that they meet,

If accident hath not eut off the scroll,

Can shew aliut of ancestry as long.

You call the Scythians barbarous, and despite them ; 10
Yet Anacharsis was a Scythian born3

And every man of a like noble nature,

Tho' he were moulded from an AEthiop’s loins,
’ Is nobler than your pedigrees can make him.

Oounrnnurrn.

Cease, if you love me, mother, cease to trace
Our long extraction toan ancient race;

'Tis theirs alone, who boast no inbred worth,

To found their claim of honour on their birth,
And strive their want of virtue to supply

With glory borrow'd from old ancestry.

That all had ancestors the proof can give,

When you admit, thot all have liv'd, or live:

If thousands find it difficult to truce

(Through lack of friends, or luckless change of place) ιο
ln whose pure veins their streame of kindred run,
Are they leus noble than the few thot can?
