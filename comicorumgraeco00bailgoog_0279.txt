These shall be always present to thy view,
Whether thou liw'st an hundred years, or few3
And nobler werke, or wrought with better skill,
None ever yet beheld, or ever will.
This life on earth, these soenes to man assign'd,
Suppose amighty coneourse of mankind,
Where all contrive to tiifle time away
In business, hustle, villainy, or play:
1f first this inn you quit, a transient guest,
You’ll pay bnt little, and you'll fare the best:
Go then equipt, nor fear the stroke of fate,
You'll travel free from envy and from hate.
But lingering guests, who longer being orave,
Must sink at last with sorrow to the grave:
For antient men experience wants and woes ¹
From friends departing or surviving foes.

y He dies not well, who, bending into age,
Droops under years, and tottering quite the stage.

To me most happy therefore he appears,

Who having once, unmov'd by hopes aud fears,
Survey'd this sun, earth, ocean, clouds, and fleme,
Well satisfy'd returns from whence he earne.

Is life a hundred years, or e'er so few,

'Tie repetition all, and nothing new:

Α fair, where thousands meet, but none can stay,
An iun, where travellers bait, then poet away;

Α sea, where man perpetually is tost, ⁸
Now plung'd in business, now in trifles lost:
Who leave it first, the peaceful port first gain,-
Hold then! no farther lauueh into the main:
Contraot your sails; life nothing can bestow

By long continuanoe, but oontinued woe:

The wretched privilege daily to deplere

The funerals of our friends, who go before:
Diseases, paine, anxieties, and cares,

And age surrounded with a thousand snares.
