VERSIONES ANGLICAE.

Than l—Demosthenes! that angry orator,

Thut bold Briareus, whose tremendous throat,

Charg'd to the teeth with bettering-rams und spears,

Beate down opposers3 brief in speech was he,

But, crost in argument, his threat‘ning eyes

F lash'd lire, whilst thunder vollied from his lips.

11. (Ρ. 111.) ·

Noy, my good friend, but hear me! I confess

Man is the child of sorrow, and this world,

111 which we breathe, bath cares enough to plague us;

But it harh means withal to sooth these cares,

And he, who meditatus on other's woes, ’

Shall in that meditation lose his own:

call then the Tragic poet to your aid,

Hear him, ond take instruction from the stage:

Let Telephus appear, behold a prince,

A spectacle of poverty end pain,

Wretched in both-And what if you are poor?

Are you a demi-god? are you the son

of Hercules? begone! complnin no more.

Doth your mind struggle with distracting thoughts?

Do your wits wander? cre you mad? Ales!

So was Alemaeon, whilst the world edor'd

His father as their 'God Your eyes are dim ς

What then? the eyes of OEdipus were dark,

Totally durh. You mourn a son, hc's deed3

Turn to the tale 01 Niobe for comfort,

And match your loss with hers. You're lame oi foot;

Compare it with the loot of Philoctetes

,And make no more complaint But you are old,

Old, und unfortrnrate ; consult Oeneus3

Hear what a king endur'd, and learn content„

Sum up your miseriei, number up your sighs,

The tragic stage shall give you tear for tear,

And wesh out all afflictione but its own.
Cuusnnnsun.
