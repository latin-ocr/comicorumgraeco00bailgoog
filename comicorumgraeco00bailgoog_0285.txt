1v. (P. 162.)

'Tis not on them alone, who tempt 'the sea,

That the storm breuks; it whelme e’en us, Ο Laches!
Whether we paee the open colonnade,

Or to the inmost shelter of our house

Shrink from ite rege. The sailor for u day,

A night perhaps, is bandied up und down,

And then anon tepores, when the wind

Veers to the wish’dfor point, and wafts him honre:

But I know no repose ; not one duy only,

But every day, to the last hour of life, lo
‚ Deeper und deeper 1 am plung'd in woe.

Cunernunn.

v. (P. 163.)

O! Cleon, cease to trifle thus with life:

A mind, so barren of experience,

Can hoard up nought but misery, believe me.
The shipwreckt mariner must sink outright,
Who makes no effort to regain the shore:

The needy wretch, who never learnt a trade,
And will not work, must aterve-What then r-you cry-
My richen-Freil security-My forme,

My loures, my estate-Ales! my friend,
Fortune makes quick dispetch und in a duy
Can strip you bure ur beggary itself.

Grant that you now had piloted your burk
Into good for'tune'r haren, enchor'd there,

And moor'd her rufe us cantion could devise;
Yet if the headetrong passione seire the helm,
And turn her out tornea, the stormy gustu
Shrll rise and blow you out of eight of port,
Never to reach prosperity egeln.-

leat tell you me? have I not friends ιο fly to?
I hwe: and will not thore kind suendo protect mei- m
Better it were you shull not need their service,
And so not make the triel: Much I fen

Your sinking hrnd would only grerp e rhude.

Cunrrruun.
