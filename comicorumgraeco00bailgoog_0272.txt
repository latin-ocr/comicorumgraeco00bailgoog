VERSIONES ANGLICAE.

To foster none but villains, and destroy

All, who are benefactors to mankind!

What was the fate of Socrates?-A prison,

,Α dose of poison3 tried, condemn’d and kill'd; 15
, How died Diogenes ?—As a dog dies,

With a raw morsel in his hungry throat:

Alas for AEsohylus! musing he walk’d,

The soaring eagle dropt a tortoise down,

And crush’d that hrain, where Tragedy had birth: 20

A paltry grape-stone choak'd the Athenion Bee:

Mattiffs of Thrace devour'd Euripides,

And god-like Homer, woe the while! was atarv'd-

Thus life, blind life teems with perpetual woes.

Cunarum.

suanno, (P. 101).

For, hythe goda! he talk'd to me in riddles,
And coin'd new words that pose me to interpret
No sooner had he enter’d on his office,

Thau, eyeing me from head to foot, he ories-
‘How many mortals hast thou bid to supperi'
Mortals! quoth 1, what tell you me of mortale?
Let Jove decide on their mortality;

You're crazy sure! none by that name are bidden.
‘No Table Usher? no one to officiare

As Master of the Courses?’—N0 such person3
Moschion and Niceratus and Philinus,

These are my guenta and friends, and amongst these
You’ll find no table-deoker, as I take it

‘Godsi is it possible Γ oried he: Most certain,

I patiently replied 3 he swell'd and huff'd

As if forsooth! l'd done him heinous wrong,

And robb’d him of his proper dignity3

Ridiculous conceit !-‘ What offering mak'st thou
To Erysichthon? he demanded: None—

‘Shall not the wide-horn'd ox be fell’dr’ ories he‚·
