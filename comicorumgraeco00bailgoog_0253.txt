238 vnnslouns Anemon.

The portiy gammon, sailing in full etate
Upon his smoeking platter, heaves in sight,
Encompass'd with his bandoliers like gundo,
And convoy⁶d by huge bowls of frumenty,
That with their generous odours scent the air.

-You etagger me to tell of these good days,
And yet to live with ue on our hard fere,

When death’s o deed as easy as to drink.

If your mouth waters now, what hed it done,
Could you have seen our delicate fine thrushes
Hot from the epit, with myrtle-berries cramm'd,
And iarded well with celandine and parsley,

Bob at your hungry lips, crying-Come ert me!

Nor was this ell; for pendent over-head

The fairest choicest fruits in clusters hung 3

Girls too, young girls just budding into bloom,

elad in transparent rests, stood near at hand

To serve us with fresh roseo, and full cupa

Of rich and fragrent wine, of which one gloss

No sooner was dispetch’d, than struit behold!

Two goblets, fresh and sparkling es the first,

Provok'd us to repeat the encreesing draught

Away then with your ploughs, we need them not,

Your scythes, your sickles, and your pruning hooks! 35

Awoy with ali your trumpery at once!

Seed-time and harvesthome and vintage wahes-

Your holidays are nothing worth to us.

Our rivers roll with luxury, our vete

O'erflow with nector, which providing Jove

Showers down by cataraots3 the very guttere

From our house-tops spout wine, vest foreste wave,

Whose very leaves drop fetnese, smoaking viends

Like mountains rise.-All nature'e one great feast
crunnum».
