VERSIONES ANGLICAE.

Trifle no longer, Cleon: if you dally,

You'll find yourself unconscious left aground

Without resource. What ship·wreck'd man, I pray you,

When tost ashore‚ could save his life, unless

By graspiug firm the strand? What child of want,

To feed himself, plies not ¹some workmnn’s art?

—‘ But we have means—Ah! quickly perish means!

—‘Lsnds, messusges'-Alss! you lack not proofs

Of fortune’s mutability, which makes

The rich man of to-dsy¹ to-morrow's beggsr.

But moor'd i’th' haven of some honest art,

We drop et will our anchor, and ride ssfely:⁴

Whereas ·if dristing on before the storm,

Untaught to 'westher it, we 've no asylum

Against the risks of unprotected age. 15
—But ‘ you hove boon-companions, friends, connexione,

So help the mark! who will supply your needs!'

Ah! pray to be deliver'd from the curse

Of friendly contributions!-1n thet honr, ,
You'll find yourself the shadow of a shsde. 20

Two words of nonsense are two words too much3
Whole volumes of good sense will never tire.
What multitudes of lines harh Homer wrote!

Whoever thought he wrote one line too much?
Coununsswn. '

vn. (P. urs.)

11 what we have we use not, and still covet
What we have not, we are cajol’d by fortune
Of present bliss, of future by ourselves.
