lf love be folly, as the schools would prove,

The man must lose his wits‚ who falls in love,·

Deny him love, you doom the wretch to death,

And then it follows he must lose his bresth ¹.

Good sooth! there is a young and dninty maid

I dearly love, s minstrel she by trade ;

What then? must I defer to pedont rule,

And own that love transforms me to a fooli·

Not 1, so help me! By the gods I sweer,

The nymph I love is fsirest of the fair ς

Wise, witty, deerer to her poet’s sight

Thon piles oi money on sn author's night 3

Must I not love her then? Let the dull sot,

Who made the lsw, obey it! 1 will not.
