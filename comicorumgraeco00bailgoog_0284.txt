1. (1111.)

All are not just, because they do no wrong ;
But he who will not wrong me when he may,
'He is the truly just. l praise not them,

Who in their petty dealings pilfer not 3

But him whose conscience spurns s secret fraud, 5 ·

When he might 'plunder and defy surprise:

His be the praise, who looking down with scorn

' On the false judgement of the partisl herd,

Consults his own clear hesrt, and boldly dares

To be, not to be thought, an honest man. 10
Cuuuunnsuo.

11. (Ρ. 156.)

Now, by the gods! it is not in the power

Of pointing, or of sculpture, to express

Aught so divine as the fair form of Truth!

The creatores oi their art may catch the eye,

But her sweet nature captivates the soul. 5
Coussnnsuo.

111. (P. 157.)

Philosophers consume much time and pains,

To seek the Sovereign Good3 nor is there one,

Who yet heth struck upon it: Virtus some,

And Prudence some contend for, whilst the knot

Grows harder by their struggle to untie it.

l, s mere clown‚ iu turning up the soil,

Have dog the secret forth s-All-gracious Jove!

'Tis Pesce, most lovely, and of sll belov'd 3

Peuce is the bounteous Goddess‚ who bestows ⁶

Weddings and holidsys and joyous feasts, ιο

Relations, friends, health, plenty, social comforts

And plessures, which alone make lifes blessing.
Coususnsuo.
