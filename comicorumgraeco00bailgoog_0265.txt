A. A cabbage! what did they discover there?

B. 0h Sir! your cabbage hath its sex and gender‚

Its provinces, prerogative's and ranke,

And, nicely handled, breeds as many questions

As it does maggots. All the younger fry

Stood dumb with expectation and respect,

Wond'ring what this same cabbage should bring forth:

The Lecturer ey'd them round, whereat a youth

Took beart, and breaking first the awful silence,

Humbly orav'd leave to think-that it was round:

The cause was now at issue, and a eeoond

Opin’d it was an herb—A third oonceiv'd

With due submissior it might be a plant-

The difference methought was such, that each

Might keep his own opinion and be right3

But soon a bolder voice broke up the council

And, stepping forward a Siciliam queck

Told them their question was abuse of time,

It was a cahbage, neither more nor less,

And they were fools to prate so much about it·-

Iusolent wretch! amazement seiz’d the troop,

Clamour and wrath and tumult rag'd amrin,

Till Plato, trembling for bis own philosophy,

And oslmly praying patience of the court,

Took up the cahbage and adjourn'd the cause.
Conseruarum

EUBULUS.

Three cups oi wine a prudent man may take3

The first oi these for constitution's sele 3

The second to the girl he loves the beet3

The third aud last to lull him to his reat,

Then home to bed! but if o fourth he pours, ⁵
That is the cup oi folly‚ and not ours3
