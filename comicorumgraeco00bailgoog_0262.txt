Love, the disturbet of the peace of heaven,
And¹ grand fomenter of Olympiam feuds,
Was banish'd from the synod of the Gods:
They drove him down to earth at the expenoe
of us poor mortals, and eurtail'd his wings
To spoil his soering and secure themselves
From his annoyence-Selfish, hard decree!
For ever since he roems th' unquiet world,
The tyrant and despoiler of mankind.
Comensem).

I've heard this arrogent impostor tell,
Amongst the 'wonders which he saw in hell,
That Pluto with his scholars sate and fed,
Singling them out from the inferior dead:
Good saith! the monarch was not ovemniee,
Thus to take up with beggary and lice.

A. Descending to theobades, he said,
To note the statuo of the dead,

He found Pythagoras's class ¹
Distinguish'd from the general mass,
And honour'd, for their striot demeenor,
With Pluto’s company to dinner.

B. Right easy, sure, the god to phase,

Who joys to mess with filths like these!
