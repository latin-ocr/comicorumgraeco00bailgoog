So gaunt they seem, that famine never mode

of lank Philippides so mere a shade3

Of salted tunny-fish their scanty dole,

Their beverage, like the frog's, a standing pool,

With now aud then a cabbage, at the best

The leavings of the oeterpillar's feast:

No romb approaches their dishevell'd hair,

To rout the long establish’d myriads there,·

On the bare ground their bed, nor do they know

A warmer coverlid than serves the crow3

Flames the meridien sun without a cloud? ’

They bask like grasshoppers, ond ohirp as loud:

With oil they never e⁰ven feast their eyes;

The luxury of stockings they despise, '

But bore-foot as the crane still moreh along 15

All night in chorus with the screeoh-owl's song.
Cunnum».

For semishment direct, and empty fare,

l am your Tithymallus, your Philippides,

close pictur’d to the life: for water-drinking,
Your very frog. To fret oud feed on leeks‚

Or other garden-stuff, your caterpillar

Is a mere fool to me. Would ye have me abjuro
All cleausiug, oll ablution? l’ur your man-

The loethsom’st scab alive—noy, filth itself,
Sheer, genuine, unsophiotioated filth.

To breve the winter with his nippiug o'old,

Α houselets tenant of the open air,

See in me all the ousel. ls’t my business,

ln sultry summer'o dry and parched season,

To dare the stilling hest, and prote the while
Mocking the noontide blare? Ι tm ot once

The grasshopper: to abhor the mother'd oilr

l am the very dust to liok it up

And blind me to its use: to wolk amornings
Barefoot? The erano: to sleep uo wink? The hot.
