Thus 1 began to commune with myself—
Methinks these painters misapply their art,
And never knew the being which they draw;
For mark! their many false conceits of Love.
Love is normale nor female, man nor god,
Nor with intelligence nor yet without it,

But a strange eompound of all these, uniting
In one mixt essence many opposites;

A mauly courage with a womau’s fear,

The madman’s phrenzy in a reasoning mind,
The strength of steel, the fury of a beast,
The ambition of a hero-something 'tis,

But by Minerva and the gods I swear!

I know not what this nameless something is.

You, Sir, a Cyrenean, as Iteke you,
Look at your seet of desperate voluptuarios ;
There's Diodorus—beggary is too good for him-
A vast inheritance in two short years,
Where is it? Squander'd, vanish'd, gone for ever: 5
So rapid was his ‹lissipation.-Stop!
Stop! my good friend, you cry3 not quite so fast!
This man went fair and sostly to his ruin 3
What talk you'of two years? As many days,
Two little days were long enough to finish
Young Epicharides3 he had some soul,

, And drove a merry paee to his undoing-

m Marry! if a kind ‘surfeit would surprise us,

Ere we sit down to earn it, such prevention
Would oome most opportune to save the trouble
Os a sick stomach and an aching head:
But whilst the punishment is out of sight,
And the full chuliee rt our lips, we drink,
Drink all to-day, tomorrow fast end monto,
Sick, and all o'er oppress'd with nauseous sumtu ρο

Such is the drunlsard's curse, and Hell itaeli'
