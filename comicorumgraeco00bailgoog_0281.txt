You rest no better than your needy neighbours,
And sorrow is the common lot of all.
Cumanum).

The rich all happy 1 was wont to hold,

Who never paid herge usury for gold.

‘Those sons of fortrme never oigh,' 1 said,
‘'Nor toss with anguish on their weary bed;
But soft dissolving into balmy sleep,

Indulge sweet olumbers, while the needy weep:'
But now the great and opulent‚ 1 see,

Lament their loto, and moum as well as we.

x. (P.142.)

If you, Ο Trophimus! end you alone

Of all your mother’o sono have Nature's choter
For privilege of pleasures uncontrourd,

With full exemption from the strokes of Fortune,
And that some god both ratified the grant,

You then with cause moy vent your loud reproach,
For he hath broke your eherter and betray’d you 3
But, if you live and breathe the common air

On the same termo os we do, then I tell you,
And tell it in the tragic poet’s words-

Qf your philosophy you make no ure„

If you give place to occidental wileh-

The sum of which philosophy ie thie-

You ore a mon, ond therefore Fortune's spurt,

Δ Thio hour exalted, and the next obas'd:

You are oman, aud, though by nature weok,

By nature arrogant, climbing to heighte

That mock your reoch and cruoh you in the fallz
Nor was the blessing you have lost the beot
