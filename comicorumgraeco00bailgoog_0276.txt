VERSIONES ANGLIGAE.

For this is Fate's immutable decree,

And one more being is reserv’d for thee :'

To bounteous Heav'n l'd thus prefer my pray’r3
‘0 let not reason's lamp be lighted here!
Make me not man ; his only partial racc

Holds vice in credit, virtue in disgrace.

The steed victorious in the rapid course

Eats food more dainty than the sluggish horse:
ls there a dog, distinguish'd for his smell?

No common dog will ever fare so well:

The gallant cock, that boasts heroic blood,
Rakes not in dirty dunghills for his food ς

And should he strut among the feather'd crew,
Each conscious brother pays him honour dua.
Man, though of each accomplishment possest,
Renown'd for valour, and with virtue blest,
Gains from the haedless world no due regard,
His worth no praise, his valour no reward:
While fawning flatterers bask in Fortune's ray,
Knaves that detract, and villains that betray.
'Tis better far thro' any form to pass,

To crawl a reptile, orto drudge an ass,

Than see base miscreants, guilt's abandon'd crew,

Enjoy those honours that are Virtue's due? F, 80
awulrs.

11. (P. 122.)

All creatores are more blest in their condition,
And in their naturas worthier than man.

Look at yond ass!-a sorry beast, you'll say,
And such intruth he ia—poor, hapless thing!
Yet these his sufferings spring not from himself, 5
For all that Nature gave him he enjoys3
Whilst we, besides our necessary ills,

Make ourselves sorrows of our own begetting:
If a man sneeze, we're sad-for that'a ill luck ;
If he traduce us, we run mad with rage;

A dream, a vapour throws us into terrore,
And let the night-owl boot, we melt with fear:
