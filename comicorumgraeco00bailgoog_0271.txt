Anda grave son of Physie fill'd his place:
My house now seem'd an hospital 'of Lazars,
And the vile beggar mangled without marey,
A very hangman bath'd in human gore.
My Soldier was a prince compared to this,
For his were merry fibs 3 this son of Death
'l'urn’d every thing he touch'd into a corpse.
When Fortune, who hed yet good store of spite,
Now coupled me to a most learn'd Philosopher3
Plenty of heard he had, a cloalr withal,
Enough to spare of each, and moral maxims
More than Ι could digest, but money-none,·
His sect abhorr'd it 3 'twas a thing proscrib'd
By his philosophy, an evil root,
And when l rsk'd him for a taste, ’twas poison; 30
Still l demanded it, and for the reason
That he so slightly priz'd it—all in vain-
l could not wring a drachma from his elumbes.-
Defend me, Heav'n! from all philosophas*

1. Π. (Pp. ss. 100.)

Is there a man just, honest, nobly born?
Malice should hunt him down. Does wealth attend him?

Trouble is hard behind-Conscience direct?-

Beggsry is at his heels: is he an Artist?

Farewell repose! An equal upright Jndge?—

Report shall blast his virtues: is he strong?-

Sickness shall sap his strength 3 acoount that day,

Which brings no new mischamen day of rest;

For what is man? what matter is he mede of?

How born? what is he, and what shall he he? 10
What an unnatursl parent is this world,
