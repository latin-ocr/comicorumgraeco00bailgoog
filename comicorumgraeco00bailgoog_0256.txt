Nor house, nor collers, nor whatever else
Is deor and precious, should be watch'd so closely,
As she whom you call wife. sad lot is ours,
Who barter lise und all its free delights,
To be the slaves of woman, and 333 prid
Her bridel portion in the luckless coin
of sorrow und vexation. A man's wrath
Is milk and honey to 3 woman's rage3
He can be much offended end forgive,
She never pardons those she most offends:
What she should do she slights, what she should not
Hotly pursues,· false to each virtuous point,
And only in her wickedness sincere.
Who hut 3 lunatic would wed and be
Will'ully wretched? better to endure ⁸
The 3133333 ol' powerty, undull its taunts
Ruther than this. The reprobate, on whom
The Censor set his brand, is justly doom'd
Unfit to govern others3 but the wretch‚
Who weds, no longer cun command himself,

Nor hus his woe 3 period but in death.

Ne’er train'd his pupils to such discipline,
As Love his rotarios, unriwall'd power,
The first great deity—and where 13133,
So stubborn end determinedly still, ¹
But shall at sometime bend the knse to Love, , 10
And make 0133133333 to his mighty shrine?

One day, 33 slowly sauutering from the port,
Α thousand cares conflicting in my bresst,
