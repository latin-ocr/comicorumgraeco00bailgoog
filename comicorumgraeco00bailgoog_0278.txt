A treble sprinkling srorn the holy mess :v
Now search your heart; if that reproach you not,
Then and then only you are truly pure.
Cunnunnann.

⁴ w. ·(P.127.) ,

If such the sex, was not the sentence just,
'l'hat rivetted Prometheus to his rocki-
- Why, sor what crime?—A spark, a little spark3
But, Oh ye Gods! how infinite the mischief-
That little spark gave being to a woman,
And let in a new race of plagues to cursous.
Where is theman that weds? shew me the wretoh:
Woe to his loti-Insatiable desires, ¹
His nuptial bed defil'd, poisoning and plote,
And maladies untold-these are the fruits 10
Of marriage, these the blessings of a wife.
Couaannsnn.

v. (P. 130.)

The lot of all most fortunate is his,

Who having staid just long enough on earth

To feast his sight with this fair face oi nature,

Sun, sea, and cloudS, and Heaven’s bright starry fires, ⁴

Drops without pain into an early grave. 5

For what is life, the longest life of man,

But the same scene repeated o'er and o’er?

A few more ling'riug days to be consum'd

In throngs and crowds‚ with sharpers, knaves and thieves,·

From such the speediest riddance is the best. 10
Cuuaunnsnn.

Him‚ Parmeno, Ideem the happiest man,

Who, having once survey'd great Nature's plan,

This beauteous system, this stupendous frome,

Soon to that place retires, from whence he came.

This common sun, the stars, the streams that flow, 5
The clouds that darken, and the fires that glow‚
