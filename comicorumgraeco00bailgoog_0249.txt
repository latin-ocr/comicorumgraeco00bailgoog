when Ι turn my thoughts to the condition of the commonuerim
for you must be conscious, 0! citizens, it was not so admixtis.
tered in times past, when men of high birth, men, whose rsnk,
fortune, and merit, gave them a consideration in the state, ffll'd
the first offices of government: To such we defert-ed, as to the
deities themselves3 for they merited our respect, and under their
protection we enjoyed security: now we have no other guide in
our election but blind ignoble chance3 and on whatsoever had
it faiis, though he be the worst and meanest of mankind, he
starts up a great man at once, and is installed with all proper
solemnity a rogue in the state.

Mark now, and learn of me the thriving arts,
By which we parasitos contrive to live:

Fine rogues we are, my friend, (of that be sure)
And duintily we gul] mankind.-0bserve!

First Ι provide myself a nimble thing

Το be my page, a varlet of all crafts 3

Next two new suits for feasts and gala-days,
Which Ι promote by turns, when I walk forth
To sun myself upon the public square:

There, if perchance Ι spy some rich dull knavc,
straight Ι accost him, do him reverencc,

And, saunt’ring up and down, with idle chat
Hold him awhile in play, at every word,

⁹ Which his wise worship utters, 1 stop short

And bless myself for wonder, if he ventures

On some vile johe, I blow it to the skies,

And hold my sides for laughter-Then to supper,

With others of our brotherhood to mess

In some night-cellar on our barley-cakes,

And club invention for the· next day's shift ρο
