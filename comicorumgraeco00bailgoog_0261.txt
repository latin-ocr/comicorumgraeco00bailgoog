Were to be rich myself 3 but next to this

1 hold it best to be a. Parasite, ’

And feed upon the rich. Now mark me right!

Set down my virtues one by one: Imprimis, ·

Good-will to ull men—would they were all rich,

So might I gull them allr mnlioe to none3

1 envy no man's fortune, all Ι wish

Is but to share it: would you have a friend,

A gallant steady friend? Ι arn your man:

No striker 1, no swaggerer‚ no defamer,

But oue to bear all these und still forbeur:

If you insult, Ι langh, unruffled, merry,

Invinoibly good-humour'd still I laugh:

A stout good soldier Ι, vulorous to a fault,

When once my stomach's up and supper serv’d:

You know my humour, not one spark of pride,

Such and the same for ever to my friends: ¹

If cudgell'd‚ molten iron to the hammer

Is not so mulleoble3 but if Ι cudgei,

Bold as the thunder: isone to be blinded?

Ι nm the lightning's flash: to be puii'd up?

Ι nm the wind to blow him to the bursting¹z

Chonk'd, strongled? I can do 't ond save n hulten:

Would you break down his doors? Behold sn earthquske:

Opeu aud enter them? Α battering-romx

Will you sit down to supper? l'm your guest,

Your very Fty to enter without bidding:

Would you move off? You'll move a well assoon:

I'm for ul work, and though the job were stabbing‚

Betraying, i'alse-aoousing, only say,

Do this! and it is done: Ι stick at nothinffi

They call me Thunder-bolt for my disputeh ;

Friend of my friends nm I: Iret actions speuk me ; 40

I'm much too modost to commend myself. Ι
