Before you outrun honesty ;· for he, ·
Who lives we know not how, must¹ live by plunder;
Either he picks a purse, or robs a house,
Or is accomplice with some knavish gang,
Or thrusts himself in crowds to play th' Informer,
And put his perjur'd evidence to sale:
This a weil-order'd city will not suffer:
Such vermin we expel--Aad pou do miaelp:
Bat what is this to mes-Why, this it is:
Here we behold you every day at work.
Living forsooth! not as your neighbours live,
But richly, royally, ye' godai-Why, man,
We cannot get a fish for love or money,
You swullow the whole produce ο1 the sea:
You’ve driven our citizens to browne on cabbage:
A sprig ο1 parsley sets them all fighting,
As at the Isthmian gamer: if hare, or partridge‚
Or but a simple thrush comes to the maritet,
Quick, at the word you snap him: By the gods!
Hunt Athens through, you ¹shall not find a feather
But in your kitchen3 aud lorwim, 'tis gold-
Not to be purchas’d-We may drink the ditches.

Wee have in Corinth this good Law in use,·
11 wee see any person keepe great cheere,
We make inquiris, Whether he doe worke,
Or 11 he have Revenues coming in?
11 either, then we say no more of him.
But 11 the Charge exceed his Gaine or Rents,
He is forbidden to run on his course:
11 he continue it, he pays a fine:
11 he want wherewithalL he is at last ⁸
Taken by Sergeants and in prison cast.
For to spend much, and never to getought,
Is cause of much disorder in the world.
One in the night-time filoheth from the flocks;
Another breaks a house or else a shop 3 . ,,
Α third man geta a share his mouth to stop. 15
To beare a part in this good fellowship '
One feignes a suit his neighbor to molest,
