MENANDER.

1. (P. 117.)

Suppose some God should say,-‘ Die when thou wilt,

Mortul, expect another life on earth ;

And for that life make choice of all creation

What thou wilt be-dog, sheep, gout, man, or horse;

For live again thou must: itis thy fate:

Chuse only in what form3 there thou art free,-

So help me, Croto, I would fairly antwer-

Iret me be all things, any thing but man 1-

He only of all creatores feels affliction:

The generque horse is valued for his worth,

And dog by merit is preferr'd to dog ;

The warrior eock is pamper'd for his couroge,

And swes the beser brood-But what is men?

Truth, virtue, valour, how do they uvuil him? ⁰

of this world's good the first end greatest share ιε

Is flettery's prius ; the informer takes the next,

And barefsc'd knsvery gnrbles whst is left

I¹d rather be an ass thnn what 1 am,

And see these villsins lord it o'er their betters.
Coussunrwn

If to my choioe indulgent Heev’n would give,

This life worn out, another life to live,

And say, ‘Partuke whnt form delights thee best,

Be man again, again with reason blest;

Assume the horse’s strength, the sheep's worm cort, 5
Burk in the dog, or wauton in the goat3
