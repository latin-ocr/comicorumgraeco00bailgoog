This is my rule, and to this rule l'll hold,
To chuse my wife by merit not by gold3
For on that one election must depend
Whether 1 wed a fury or a friend.

Cuuuruusuo.

When your foe dies, let ull resentment cesse,
Make peace with death, and death shall give you peace.

EPIGRATES. (P. 66.)

Α. 1 pray you, sir, (for I perceive you learn'd
ln these grave matters) let my ignoranoe suok
Some profit from your courtesy, ond tell me
What are your wire philosophers engug'd in,
Your Plato, Menedemus and Speusippus?

What mighty mysteries have they in projectior?
What new discoveries may the world expect
From their profound researches? 1 conjure you,
By Earth, our common mother, *to impart them!
B. sir, you shall know at our great festival

1 was myself their horror, aud so much

As I there heard will preseutly disolose,

So you will give it ears, forl must speok

of things perchonoe surpassing your belief,

So strange they will appear3 but so it happen'd,
That these most suge Academicians sate

ln solemn consultatiou-on a cabbege.
