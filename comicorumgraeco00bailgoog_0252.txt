1. (Ρ. 15.)

Age is the heaviest burthen man can bear,
Compound of disappointment, pain, and care,·
For when the mind's experience comes at length,
It comes to mourn the body's losa of strength:
Resign'd to ignorante all our better days,
Knowledge just ripens‚ when theman decays3
One ray of light the closing eye receives,

Ι And wisdom only takes what folly leaves.

Cuuasanauo.

11. (riv.)

Remark, how wisely ancient art provides

The broad-brimm'd cup with flat expanded sides;

A cup contriv'd for man's discreeter use,

And sober portions of the generous juice:

But woman's more ambitious thirsty soul

Soon long'd to revel in the plenteous bowl;

Deep and capacious as the swelling hold

of some stout berk she shap’d the hollow mould,

Then turning outa vessel like a tun,

Simp'ring exelaim'd-Observe! I drink hutone. 10
Cuusunuaun.

111.1v. (Pp. 18. 25.)

Τὴθ days of Plutus were the days of gold ς

The season of high. feeding, and good cheer:

Rivers of goodly beef and brewis ran

Boiling and bubbling through the streaming streets,

With islanda of fat dumplings, cut in sops 5
And slippery gobbets, moulded into mouthfuls‚ '

That dead men might have swallow'd3 floating tripes,

And fleets of sausages‚ in luscious morsels,

Stuck to the banks like oysters: Here and there,

For relishers, a salt-fish season'd high 10
Swam down the savoury tide: When soon behold!
