Moulding the young novitiate to her trader
Form, features, mannerS, every thing so chang'd,
That not o trace of former self is left.
Is the wenoh short? a triple sole of cork
Exalts the pigmy to a proper size.
Is she too tall of stature? a low cheir
Softens the fault, and a fine easy stoop
Lowers her to standard-pitch.-lf narrow-hipt,-
A handsome wedding readily supplies
What nature stints, and all beholders cry,
See what plump haunchesl-Hath the nymph perchance
A high round pauneh‚ stoft like our comio drolls,
And strutting out foreright? a good stout busk
Pushing athwart shall force the intruder back.
Hath she red brows? a little soot will core 'em.
Is she too black? the ceruse makes her fair:
Τοο pale of hue? the opol comes in aid.
Hath she a beauty out of sight? disclose it!
strip nature bare without a blush.-Fine teeth?

“ Let her effect one everlasting grin,
Laugh without stint-but ah! if laugh she cannot,
And her lips won’t obey, take a fine twig
Of myrtle, shope it like a butcher’s skewer,
And prop them open, set her on the bltt
Day after day, when out of sight, till use
Grows second nature, ond the pearly row,

Will she or will she not, perforce appears.
Commune.

1v. (P. 33.)

Am one, and from my own experienee speak.
