Β. There is ajuice drawn from the Carpin tree,

To which your dove instinctively is wedded

With a most loving appetite3 with this

A holder pitch‚ sostrong elove-charm draws' them,
And perch, 0 horror! ou his sacred crown,

Of the bye-standers,' who, with reverend care,

Ah! good my master, you may sigh for death,

And coll amaiu upon him to release you,

But wlll you bid him welcome when he comes?

Not you. Old Charon has a stubborn task

To tug you to his wherry, and dislodge you

From your rich tables, when your hour is come:

Α good, brisk, sweeping, epidemio plague:

There's nothing else cau make you all immortal.
