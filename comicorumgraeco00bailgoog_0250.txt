PLATO.

1. (P. s.)

‘Hos there! who art thou? Ansuer me-Art dumb?'
‘- Warm from the hand of Daedalus I come3
My name Mercurius, und, as you may prove,
A statue; but his statues speak and move!

11. (Ρ. 9.)

By the sea's margin, on the watery strand,
Thy monument, Themistocles, shall stand:
By this directed to thy native shore
The merchant shall convey his freighted store ,-
And when our fleets are summon’d to the fight, 5
Athens shall conquer with thy tomb in sight
Consentino.

Thy grave is set and plac'd commodiously‚

Where passengers and merehonts that come by

May visit thee, and where it may regurd

All such as seeke that port to be their ward.

Sometimes also, it may rejoice to 'see 5

' The bloody fights upon the sea that be.

Ost, ss the merchant speeds the passing scil, ΜΗ
Thy tomb‚ Themistocles he stops to hail:

When hostile ships in martial combat meet,

Ι Thy shsde attending hovers o'er the fleet.

111. (P. 9.)

Fsrnnn. Thou hest destroy'd the moruls of my son,
And turn'd his mind, not so diepos'd, to vice,
Unholy pedagogue! With morning drams,

A filthy custom‚ which he caught from thee,

Clean from his former practice, now he saps
