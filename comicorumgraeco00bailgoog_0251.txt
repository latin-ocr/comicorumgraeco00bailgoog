His youthiul vigour. Is it thus you school him?

Sormsr. And if l did, what hsrms him? Why complain you?
He does but follow what the wise prescribe,
The great voluptuous law of Epicurus,
Pleasure, the best of all good things on earth ς 10
And how but thus can pleasure be obtain'd?
Fsrflme. Virtue will give it him. Sormsr. And what but virtue
Is our philosophy? When have you met
One of ou'r sect flush'd and disguis’d with wine?
Or one, but one of those you tax so rouudly, 15
On whom to lix a‘fault? Furrina. Notene, but all,
All, who march forth with supercilious brow
High arch'd with pride, beating the city-rounds‚
Like constables in quest of rogues and out-laws
Το lind that prodigy in human nature,
A wise and perfect man! What is your science
But kitchen-science? wisely to descant
Upon the choice bits of a savoury corp,
And prove by logic that his summum bouum
Lies in his head ; there you can lecture well, 25
And, whilst your grey-beards wag, the gaping guest
sits wondering with a foolish sace of proice.
Cunnnuusun.

currus (Ρ. 14.)

These shrivell'd sinews, and this bending frame,

The workmanship of Time’s strong hand proclaim 3

Skill’d to reverse whcte'er the gods create,

And make that crooked, which they fashion straight.

Hard choice for man, to die-or else to be

That tottering‚ wretched, wrinkled thing you see:

Age then wc ull preser3 for age we pray,

And travel on to life's last ling'ring'dey ;

'l'hen siuking slowly down from worse to worse,

Find hesv’n's extorted boon our greatest curse. 10

Cuussnmuo.
