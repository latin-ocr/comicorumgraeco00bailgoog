vr. (P. 134.)

Thou seem’st to me, young man, not to perceive

That every thing contains within itselt'

The seeds and sources of its own corruption:

The cankering rust corrodes the brightest steel;

The moth frete out your garment, and the worm

Eats its slow wey into the solid oak3

But Envy, of all evil things the worst,

The same to-dey, to-morrow, ond for ever,

Sapo and consumes the hears, in which it lurks.
Cunnnnnsnn.

vn. vrn. (Pp.136.140.)

Weak is the Vanity that boasts of riches,

For they are fleeting things: were they not such,

Conld they be yours to all succeeding time,

'Twere wise to let none share in the possession: .

But if whate’er you have is held of fortune,

And not of right inherent, why, my father,

Why with such niggard jeolousy engross

What the next hour may ravish from your grasp,

And cast into some worthless favourite's lap?

Snatch then the swift occasion, while 'tis yours; 10

Put this unstoble boon to nobler uses 3

Foster the wants of men, impert your werith,

And purchase friends3 'twill be more lasting treasure,

And, when missortune comes your best resource.
Cuunnnnunn.

rx. (Ρ. 141.)

Ne'er trust me, Phanias, buti thought till now,

That you rich follows had the knack of sleeping ’
Α good sound nup, that held you for the night 3

And not like us poor rogues, who toss and turn,
Sighing, Ab me! and grumbling ot our duns:

But now I find, in spite oi' all your money
