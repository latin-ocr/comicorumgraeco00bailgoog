To know the origin from whence you came,
And the frail fushion of this human frume,
Panse o'er those monuments with peusive eye,

· Where purpled tyrants‚ proud oppressore lie;

All who could boast weelth, wisdom, beauty, birth, 5

Here meet, end mingle with one common earth:

Yet these no bright accomplishments could save

From Fate’s dread sentence to the gloomy grave:

There while you read the frailty of your herne,

Learn from what vile original you came. 10

Whoe'er thou art, that seek'st thyself to know,

Th' importent truth each wayside tomb will show:
Each wayside lomb within itself contains

Bones, and a little dust—the poor remains

Ol king, or warrior chief, or gifted sege3

Or him, who of his wealth or parentage

Bragg’d loudly, or his mighty meed of fame,

His well-lenit sinews and his vigorous frome.

Yet none of these had power to turn aeide

Fate's mortul shall—One common death they died,
And sank alike to Pluto's realms below—

* Hence, tutor’d from each tomb, essey thyself to know.
